This Wikipedia link leads to a section describing a set of humorous, highly inefficient sorting algorithms, with *"**Quantum Bogosort**"* being my personal favourite. 

I think it's interesting because it highlights computer scientists' nature to refine something to the maximum, even if it is in a 'wrong' direction; in this case, assuring finiteness for a comically inefficient sorting algorithm is not as easy at it may first seem. I also think it's a very good study on computational complexities, and stumbling on this page in high school was only the second time I had ever ran into the [Ackermann function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function).

> **Juan Diego Castaño Molina:** I really enjoyed the related algorithms section, seeing Gorosort and Bozosort made me find a playful side of algorithm design and how computer scientists explore even the craziest ideas.
